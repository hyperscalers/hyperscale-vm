//! The manifest as routing consumes it: typed invocation nodes in
//! topological order, with value flows bound as literals or as edges
//! carrying a static resource type.
//!
//! The graph's full form — typed edges with single-producer/single-consumer
//! linearity and constraint annotations — is admission's concern. Routing
//! reads only what signatures evaluate over: each node's target, method, and
//! bound inputs. Amounts are dynamic; types are static.
